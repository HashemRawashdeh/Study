# What's The Purpose Of This Repositry?

This repository serves as a personal repository that allows me to track and version control my study progress. It is also serving as a decomentation to my neverending learning journey.

# What Will Be Studied?

I am mostly interested in the methodologies and means by which we humans gather knowledge, maily the natural sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Biology), their tools (Mathematics, Logic) and their applications (Engineering, Technology, Social Sciences). Also, some existential philosophy, and religious topics will be looked into.
I am deeply interested in various other topics as well, such as languages, poetry, TV, Games, Sports, Helth, fitness, Chess, people,..etc. In conclusion, I will be tracking seemingly random topics with the goal of me locking back on this repository 50 years or so later and seeing the journy I've lived.

# What's The Duration Of This Journy?

This Journey began once I hit adolescent, and ends when I die, but this repository will cover the parts of this Journy after the day 4/12/2022.

# The current topic:

I'm currently studying to become a machine learning engineer, then a data scientist. This means that I will be covering various mathematical, programming related, and field specific topics. 

#Topics Covered to Date:

Nothing fully documented here yet.
