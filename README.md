## What's The Purpose Of This Repository?
This repository serves as a personal repository that allows me to track and version control my study progress. It is also serving as documentation of my neverending learning journey

## What Will Be Studied?
I am mostly interested in the methodologies and means by which we humans gather knowledge, mainly the natural sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Biology), their tools (Mathematics, Logic), and their applications (Engineering, Technology, Social Sciences). Also, some existential philosophy and religious topics will be looked into.

I am deeply interested in various other topics as well, such as languages, poetry, TV, Games, Sports, health, fitness, Chess, people,..etc. In conclusion, I will be tracking seemingly random topics with the goal of me looking back on this repository 50 years or so later and seeing the journey I've lived.

## What's The Duration Of This Journey?
This Journey began once I hit adolescence and ends when I die, but this repository will cover the parts of this journey after the day of 4/12/2022.

## The current topic:
I'm currently studying to become a machine learning engineer, then a data scientist. This means that I will be covering various mathematical, programming-related, and field-specific topics.

## Topics Covered to Date:
Nothing is fully documented here yet.
